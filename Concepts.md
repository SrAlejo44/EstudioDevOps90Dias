- Â¿What is DevOps?

**DevOps** is a work methodology with a collaborative approach between the **Dev**elopment and **Op**eration**s** area, which seeks software development, automation, implementation, and maintenance. The **DevOps** work model offers Speed, Reliability, Security, Scale, and Rapid Delivery ðŸ’».

- DevOps Life Cycle

The DevOps life cycle details 8 phases that relate to the ongoing development, integration, testing, deployment, and monitoring of software.

**Plan**: Phase in which the activities are defined taking into account a minimum of functionalities that the product must comply with, monitoring and delivery times can also be defined.

**Code**: Code development phase according to the requirements agreed with the client and its review. These developments proceed in small processes in the development cycle.

**Build**: Build the application with the integration of various codes that were made in the coding phase. In this phase of the DevOps lifecycle, software development is continuous and iterative, with each part moving forward in the process. 

**Test**: phase of verifying the operation of the development to obtain feedback on possible improvements, business risks and performance measurement.


**Release**: once you execute the previous phases and the functional tests have been satisfactorily completed by the application, a version of the software can be created.

**Deploy**: after the version is approved, we proceed with the move to production.

**Operate**: In this phase, the operations team helps with the installation, configuration and administration of the infrastructure to have the application in production, managing the capacity and available resources, managing records and backups. Security checks are carried out and that there are no problems that could cause affectations, in which case immediate decisions must be made (suspend, revert, etc.) and plan the necessary improvements before returning to production.


**Monitor**: In this last phase, information is collected on different parameters such as application performance, user experience and platform health, this allows to identify improvements that can be implemented to the software, so that new versions arise which are built having take into account the phases prior to the monitoring phase.
